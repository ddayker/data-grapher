The application is designed to build pie chars with the ability to save them to your device or share them in messengers or social networks.
________
*The application has not been fully completed, BUT in the context of this project*

- *I have improved my skills working with `xml` and `fragments`, as well as `Live Data` `(Single Live Event)`*
- *I studied the splitting of the application by `architectural layers`, `mvvm`, `hilt`, used `MPAndroid Chart Library`*
- *I implemented new features for myself, such as `saving and sending` a view as an image, authorization using `firebase`.*
